How to make you own theme
==================
Creating your own theme is easy.<br/>
Have a look at Pawel's bare Brackets theme [here](https://github.com/trimek/BearTheme/blob/master/BearTheme.css).<br/>
Copy it, customize it and add it to the custom themes folder (on windows it is located at C:\Users\\[USERNAME]\AppData\Roaming\Brackets\custom themes) (on a mac it is located at ~/Library/Application Support/Brackets/custom themes).


How to install
==================
Installing Themes for Brackets is easy. All you have to do is this:
* file->extension manager..., or click the lego brick icon in the right toolbar
* Click the tab called "available"
* Type "themes" in the top right search bar
* Locate "Themes for Brackets" (not to be confused with just "Themes", which is a completely other extension, which doesn't style all of Brackets) and click the install button next to it

If you are having trouble installing the extension that way, you can follow theses steps instead (the first approach is to be preffered)
* file->extension manager..., or click the lego brick icon in the right toolbar
* Install from url...
* Copy https://github.com/Jacse/themes-for-brackets in there and click OK

Troubleshooting
==================
* There are no commands in the themes menu
 - Try re-opening Brackets, that should help it.
 - If that doesn't help and you're on a Mac, you might need to create the /Applications/Brackets.app/Contents/www/extensions/dev folder.
* Line numbers are looking weird or scrollbars are not styled/have dissapeared
 - Try hitting F5 (Save changes before doing so!).
